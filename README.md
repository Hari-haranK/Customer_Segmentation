# Customer_Segmentation
CODTECH INTERNSHIP TASK 2

#Customer Segmentation Project
#Overview
This project involves building a customer segmentation model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors and demographic information. This segmentation helps in understanding different customer profiles and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Mall_Customers.csv, which contains information about customers such as:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Annual Income: Annual income of the customer in $000
Spending Score: A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature
Project Structure
Customer_Segmentation.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploration, and the implementation of the customer segmentation model.
Mall_Customers.csv: The dataset used for this project.

#Methodology
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
Explored the data using visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Modeling:

Applied various clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) to segment customers.
Evaluated the performance and effectiveness of different models.
Results and Insights:

Analyzed the characteristics of each customer segment.
Provided recommendations for marketing strategies based on the segmentation results.
